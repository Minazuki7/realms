  "about": "I'm a full-stack engineer who leads by example. With 4+ years of hands-on experience, I don't just manage teams—I code with them, architect solutions, and ship features. At Defendr.gg, I served as CTO/Tech Lead: designed scalable microservices, led a team of 8+, conducted code reviews, built CI/CD pipelines (40% faster deployments), and optimized performance by 5%. I'm equally comfortable implementing features as I am mentoring junior developers and teaching at GoMyCode. I believe the best leaders ship code. I thrive in fast-paced environments solving complex engineering problems, whether as individual contributor, tech lead, or architect. Passionate about modern tooling, DevOps practices, and building high-performing teams.",
